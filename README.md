# Street Lighting's Impact on Urban Sexual Assaults in Louisville Metro (2023)

## Introduction

This project investigates the relationship between street lighting infrastructure and sexual assault incidents in Louisville, Kentucky during 2023. The analysis combines data from city 311 service requests for streetlight maintenance with official sexual assault crime reports to examine whether areas with higher concentrations of streetlight requests correlate with sexual assault patterns, particularly during nighttime hours.

The project aims to:
- Analyze the geographic and temporal distribution of sexual assault incidents across council districts
- Examine streetlight infrastructure requests and their patterns across Louisville
- Explore potential correlations between streetlight density and assault rates
- Provide data-driven insights for urban safety planning and resource allocation

## Usage

The project consists of three main Jupyter notebooks that should be run in sequence:

### 1. Sexual Assaults Analysis (`sexual assaults analysis.ipynb`)
This notebook performs exploratory data analysis on sexual assault incidents:
- Loads and cleans the assault incident dataset
- Filters for 2023 incidents and nighttime occurrences.
- Analyzes assault patterns by:
  - Gender of victims
  - Age distribution
  - Geographic distribution (council districts)
  - Temporal trends (monthly patterns)
  - Race/age demographics

**Run:**
```bash
jupyter notebook "sexual assaults analysis.ipynb"
```

### 2. Street Lights Analysis (`streetlights analysis.ipynb`)
This notebook analyzes streetlight infrastructure and maintenance requests:
- Loads and processes the 311 service request data
- Filters for streetlight-related requests
- Analyzes streetlight request patterns by:
  - Council district distribution
  - Monthly trends
  - Request frequency and status
  - Top service request categories

**Run:**
```bash
jupyter notebook "streetlights analysis.ipynb"
```

### 3. Combined Analysis (`Combined Analysis.ipynb`)
This notebook merges and correlates the two datasets:
- Combines assault and streetlight data at the district and monthly level
- Performs statistical analysis including:
  - Correlation tests (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall)
  - Normality assessments (Shapiro-Wilk tests)
  - LOWESS regression analysis
  - Heatmaps showing the relationship between streetlights and assaults
  - Identifies districts with both high streetlight requests and high assault rates

**Run:**
```bash
jupyter notebook "Combined Analysis.ipynb"
```
